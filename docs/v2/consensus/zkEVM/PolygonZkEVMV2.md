Contract responsible for managing the states and the updates of L2 network.
There will be a trusted sequencer, which is able to send transactions.
Any user can force some transaction and the sequencer will have a timeout to add them in the queue.
The sequenced state is deterministic and can be precalculated before it's actually verified by a zkProof.
The aggregators will be able to verify the sequenced state with zkProofs and therefore make available the withdrawals from L2 network.
To enter and exit of the L2 network will be used a PolygonZkEVMBridge smart contract that will be deployed in both networks.
