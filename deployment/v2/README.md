## Requirements

-   node version: 14.x
-   npm version: 7.x

## Deployment

In project root execute:

```
npm i
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill `.env` with your `MNEMONIC` and `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`
If you want to verify the contracts also fill the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`

```
cd deployment
cp deploy_parameters.json.example deploy_parameters.json
```

Fill created `deploy_parameters.json` with appropiate parameters.
See below for more information about the `deploy_parameters.json`

The first step is deploying and verifying the `PolygonZkEVMDeployer`, this will be the factory for deterministic contracts, the address of the contracts will depend on the `salt` and the `initialZkEVMDeployerOwner`

This contrat is deployed using a keyless deployment, therefore the gasPrice is hardcoded.
The value is on `100 gweis`, if it's necessary to update it go to `helpers/deployment-helpers.js` and update the `gasPriceKeylessDeployment` constant.
Note that this operation will change all the deterministic address deployed.

```
npm run deploy:deployer:ZkEVM:goerli
npm run verify:deployer:ZkEVM:goerli
```

To deploy on testnet is necessary a token MATIC contract, therefore, there's another script that previously to the actual deployment, deploys a matic contracts and adds it automatically to the `deploy_parameters.json`

To deploy on testnet use:`deploy:testnet:ZkEVM:${network}`

In other cases use fullfill `maticTokenAddress` in the `deploy_parameters.json` and run `deploy:ZkEVM:${network}`

```
npm run deploy:testnet:ZkEVM:goerli

```

To verify contracts use `npm run verify:ZkEVM:${network}`

```
npm run verify:ZkEVM:goerli
```

A new folder will be created witth the following name `deployments/${network}_$(date +%s)` with all the output information and the OZ proxy information.

## deploy-parameters.json

-   `test`: bool, Indicate if it's a test deployment, which will fund the deployer address with pre minted ether and will give more powers to the deployer address to make easier the flow.
-   `timelockAdminAddress`: address, Timelock owner address, able to send start an upgradability process via timelock
-   `minDelayTimelock`: number, Minimum timelock delay,
-   `salt`: bytes32, Salt used in `PolygonZkEVMDeployer` to deploy deterministic contracts, such as the PolygonZkEVMBridge
-   `initialZkEVMDeployerOwner`: address, Initial owner of the `PolygonZkEVMDeployer`
-   `admin`: address, Admin address, can adjust RollupManager parameters or stop the emergency state
-   `trustedAggregator`: address, Trusted aggregator address
-   `trustedAggregatorTimeout`: uint64, If a sequence is not verified in this timeout everyone can verify it
-   `pendingStateTimeout`: uint64, Once a pending state exceeds this timeout it can be consolidated by everyone
-   `emergencyCouncilAddress`:address, Emergency council addres
-   `polTokenAddress`: address, Matic token address, only if deploy on testnet can be left blank and will fullfilled by the scripts.
-   `zkEVMDeployerAddress`: address, Address of the `PolygonZkEVMDeployer`. Can be left blank, will be fullfilled automatically with the `deploy:deployer:ZkEVM:goerli` script.

## create_rollup_parameters.json

-   `realVerifier`: bool, Indicates whether deploy a real verifier or not for the new created
-   `trustedSequencerURL`: string, trustedSequencer URL
-   `networkName`: string, networkName
-   `description`: string, Description of the new rollup type
-   `trustedSequencer`: address, trusted sequencer addresss
-   `chainID`: uint64, chainID of the new rollup
-   `adminZkEVM`: address, Admin address, can adjust Rollup parameters
-   `forkID`: uint64, Fork ID of the new rollup, indicates the prover (zkROM/executor) version
-   `consensusContract`: string, Consensus contract name of the new rollup deployed, current options are: "PolygonZkEVMEtrog","PolygonValidiumEtrog",
-   `gasTokenAddress`: address, Gas token address, empty or address(0) for ether

### Optional Parameters on both parameters

-   `deployerPvtKey`: string, pvtKey of the deployer, overrides the address in `MNEMONIC` of `.env` if exist
-   `maxFeePerGas`: string, Set `maxFeePerGas`, must define aswell `maxPriorityFeePerGas` to use it
-   `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: string, Set `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, must define aswell `maxFeePerGas` to use it
-   `multiplierGas`: number, Gas multiplier with 3 decimals. If `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` are set, this will not take effect
-   `dataAvailabilityProtocol`: string, Data availability protocol, only mandatory/used when consensus contract is a Validiums, currently the only supported value is: `PolygonDataCommittee`

## Notes

-   Since there are deterministic address you cannot deploy twice on the same network using the same `salt` and `initialZkEVMDeployerOwner`. Changing one of them is enough to make a new deployment.
-   It's mandatory to delete the `.openzeppelin` upgradebility information in order to make a new deployment
-   `genesis.json` has been generated using the tool: `1_createGenesis`, this script depends on the `deploy_parameters` aswell.
